        "Industrial buildings are typically larger, box-like structures with flat roofs and are often surrounded by parking lots and loading docks, while other types of land have a more diverse and natural appearance.",
        "A visual cue unique to industrial buildings is the presence of large smokestacks or chimneys often emitting visible plumes of smoke."
    ],
    "Pasture Land": [
        "Pasture land in a centered satellite photo appears as a green, open area with scattered trees or bushes, often with some livestock present.",
        "Clumped pattern of green vegetation with varying shades, often bordered by trees, and less distinct pattern and texture compared to crop fields.",
        "Pasture land can be identified in a satellite photo by its green color and regular patterns of vegetation that are evenly spaced.",
        "Pasture land appears as open grasslands with occasional patches of trees, while other types of land may have different colors, textures or shapes.",
        "The presence of green vegetation with scattered trees and bushes in a centered satellite photo indicates the area as a Pasture Land."
    ],
    "Permanent Crop Land": [
        "Permanent crop land appears as small, evenly spaced circles or rectangles that are green in color, distinct from surrounding land cover.",
        "Permanent Crop Land typically has repetitive patterns, regular shapes, and smaller size compared to other land types with visible vegetation.",
        "Permanent crop land can be identified by the presence of evenly spaced, geometrically shaped plots with distinct patterns and colors.",
        "Permanent Crop Land appears as a regular pattern of vegetation rows while other land types appear as irregular and varied patterns.",
        "The regular geometric shapes of the crop rows and the consistent green texture of vegetation are unique visual cues of Permanent Crop Land."
